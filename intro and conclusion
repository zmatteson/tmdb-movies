Introduction:
	When movies hit the box office, the number one thing everyone wants to know is how much the movie is going to make. We decided to take information from the TMDB database and use the information about the movie, predict the revenue of the movie and compare it to the actual revenue. The reason we chose profitability is because there are several trends in the movie industry and often a movie’s profitability surpasses the normal trends or fails compared to the normal trend. Within the TMDB database, there are attributes that one would talk about when creating a movie or comparing it to other successful movies. The attributes would include: director, genre, release date, title, revenue, budget, IMDB score, IMDB rating count, keywords, etc. Some previous work that has been done with this dataset is predicting the rating of the movie compared to other movies with the same genre and director. We took this idea and we changed it so instead of finding the rating with genres and other movie ratings, we would find the revenue of the movie using budge, genre, IMDB score, and IMDB rating count. The methods we decide to use were linear regression, support machine vector, and neural network. Both linear regression and support machine vector determined revenue based on budget, IMDB score and IMDB score count while the neural network determined revenue based on budget, IMDB score, IMDB score count, and genre. The methods ranked in order form least successful to most successful would be support vector machine, linear regression, and finally neural network. We didn’t have enough time to fine tune the support vector machine so it’s predictions were constantly off. Linear regression had a 73% accuracy and neural network had the highest accuracy with and accuracy rate of 82%.

Conclusion:
	Overall, we were happy with the results of the methods and we learned how machine learning can be applied to everyday industries. Everyone in the group contributed to the project, but we each did different things for the group. Zeb worked on the linear regression and support vector machine methods while Evan worked on the neural network method. Everyone contributed to the presentation and to this paper, with everyone working on a different section. One section that we would like to work on in the future is fine tuning the methods to make them more accurate. The support vector machine’s accuracy was the worst of all three methods, so it would make more sense to go back and try to make it as accurate as it can be and compare it to the other methods. Overall, we would like to try to see if we can fine tune any more of the methods and see how more accurate they can be. Another thing we would like to do in the future is see how much budget can affect revenue. The biggest indicator for how much a movie is going to make is the size of its budget and we want to know if we could use any of the methods with just the budget and get a high accuracy rate. The last plan for the future would be to see how other nonnumerical attributes can help determine the revenue. What would the accuracy be if we used neural networks using the director and production company attributes? If a movie has a good budget but a bad director, does that affect the accuracy of the revenue? These are questions that we would like to answer. This project ultimately helped us understand how much goes into machine learning in order for it to be usable. We did not come up with a way to predict how much revenue a movie with make, but we learned what factors affect revenue. We also learned how machine learning could be used for all kinds of industries. Creating a method that learns the trends of movies and predicts the revenue could be amazing for the industry, there are other factors that cause certain movies to drift away from the normal trend.
